## {{page.title}}

WordCram installs like any normal Processing library -- just download,
unzip, and copy it into the "libraries" folder.

* Make sure you have Processing installed and working on your computer
  * version 2.0 or greater should be fine.
* [Download](https://wordcram.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/wordcram.0.6.1.zip) and unzip WordCram.
* Open your Processing sketchbook folder, where all your sketches are saved. If you don't know where your Processing sketchbook folder is, open Processing, and in *File > Preferences*, look for "Sketchbook folder".
* In your Processing sketchbook folder, there should be a folder named libraries. Copy the WordCram folder into it.
* Restart Processing.

WordCram is installed!

## Run a Sample WordCram

In Processing, open *File > Examples...*. Look under *Contributed Libraries > WordCram*, and run the 'helloWorld' example.
