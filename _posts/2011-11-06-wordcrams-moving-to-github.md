I started moving [WordCram on to GitHub](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/), and most things are in place, like the [issues list](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/issues) and the [wiki](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/wiki). <del datetime="2011-11-06T14:03:43+00:00">I still need to copy over the downloads</del>. Got the [downloads](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/downloads), too! (Only 0.5.0 for now - the older ones are still at [googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/downloads/list), but I'll probably copy them too, eventually.)

Let me know if I missed anything!
