Two tiny bug fixes: preventing array-out-of-bounds errors whenÂ maxNumberOfWordsToDraw is set too high, and ignoring skipped words when checking for overlaps.

Grab the fresh bits at [github](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/downloads)! The deploy process is still not automated (after moving to github), so if anything's amiss, let me know.
