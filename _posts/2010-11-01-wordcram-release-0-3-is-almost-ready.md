It may seem like October's been a quiet month for WordCram, but the 0.3 release is almost ready. I just built a daily release ([.zip](http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/downloads/detail?name=wordcram.20101031.zip), or [.tar.gz](http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/downloads/detail?name=wordcram.20101031.tar.gz)) that has more javadocs, new examples, and some new methods that control text parsing: `upperCase()`, `lowerCase()`, and `keepCase()`, and `includeNumbers()` and `excludeNumbers()`.  Not to mention building a WordCram from a webpage, and a newer, easier way to configure your WordCram.

I'm hoping to release 0.3 late this week, but in the meantime, you can try out the Halloween daily builds, and let me know what you think.
