This release includes three bug fixes ([#6](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/issues/6), [#7](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/issues/7), and [#8](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/issues/8)), and some small performance improvements, that should get us a tiny bit closer to [faster wordcrams](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/64696). Get the [better bits](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/downloads), and happy hacking!
