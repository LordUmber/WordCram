I just realised I never posted a link to the [WordCram interview](http://szamitogepesnyelveszet.blogspot.com/2010/11/word-cram-interview-with-its-creator.html) that Zoltán Varjú was kind enough to conduct!

Zoltán runs a blog called [Számítógépes nyelvészet](http://szamitogepesnyelveszet.blogspot.com/) (which Google tells me is Hungarian for Computational Linguistics) where he regularly interviews people working in computational linguistics and related fields.  Impressive company for WordCram to keep. His blog is worth checking out -- there are a number of English posts, and Google Translate helps with the rest, for non-Hungarian-speakers like me.

Zoltán, I'm terribly sorry for letting it slip.  Thanks again for the interview!
