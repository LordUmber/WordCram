[WordCram 0.6.1 is here](//wordcram.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/wordcram.0.6.1.zip), with improvements to the examples, and some bug fixes.

Two new examples show how to use the new ShapeBasedPlacer, and the Event callbacks introduced in 0.6.0. Also, some examples were still using the old WordCram.NO_SPACE constants - thanks to [Pierre Haessig for a fix](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/pull/61). Look under File > Examples > Contributed Libraries > WordCram to see them.

Happy word cramming!
